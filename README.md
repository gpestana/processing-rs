# processing-rs
An implementation of Processing for the Rust programming language,
with insipriation from openFrameworks and libCinder. It has been
developed by Robert Ennis in the lab of Katja Doerschner, a part of
the Allgemeine Psychologie Department at the Justus-Liebig
Universitaet of Giessen.

Better testing for errors is due in the coming days.

Please see the basic example for typical usage and the documentation for some
explanation of the commands. Since this is modeled after Processing, you can
also use their documentation for extra clarification, as well as examples of the
commands.
